    Come prepared with an idea or two of some open source ruby that you'd like to hack on, be it a brand new gem, a new feature in an old gem, or just some bug fixing. Come prepared to help someone else out with their idea. We'll break into pairs, or larger groups, or whatever seems natural - and we'll see how much we can accomplish in two to three hours.
    
    Our friends at Intridea will supply pizza.
    
    There is no minimum skill level - hacking with other people is a great way to learn, so if you don't have any open source ambitions of your own, or you are still new to ruby, that's okay! Come to help others, and come to learn.
    
    Feel free to bounce around ideas in "Talk about this Meetup" below!
