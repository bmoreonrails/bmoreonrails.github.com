        <h2>Stay with a Local</h2>
        <p>As part of a larger effort to welcome the Rails community to Baltimore for RailsConf 2010, B'more on Rails has organized a room-share for RailsConf attendees. We have 12 private rooms available to attendees for the duration of the conference. We see it as an opportunity to welcome you to our city and for us to create a few new friendships.</p>

        <h2>BohConf</h2>
        <p>BohConf is the official RailsConf 2010 unconference. At BohConf, we're going to get our hands dirty writing code and sharing ideas in an open and free-form environment. This hacking-centric event will include community code drives featuring well known OSS authors, a code retreat, a programming competition, and barcamp-style discussions. It is free and will run alongside RailsConf in the convention center. Everyone is welcome at BohConf.</p>

        <p>Ignite events are lightning talks, where 16 speakers each get 5 minutes to talk about a subject they are passionate about, but with a twist: the speaker's slides are automatically advanced every 15 seconds. Several B'More on Rails members are presenting!</p>
